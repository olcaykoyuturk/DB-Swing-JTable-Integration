# DB and Swing JTable

## Purpose

The main objective of this project is to transfer the data coming from MySQL database to a Swing JTable, providing a seamless integration between the database and the graphical user interface.

## Tier Architecture - MVC (Model View Controller)

The project follows the MVC (Model View Controller) architectural pattern. This approach enhances the modularity, readability, and maintainability of the application by addressing the data, user interface, and operational logic separately.
